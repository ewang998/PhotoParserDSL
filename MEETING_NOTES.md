# Meeting Notes

## 10/9/2020
### TA
- Status update of implementations
  - Using code from class, should citie where code was taken from
  - Put comments on top of the class if entire code/class was taken from lecture material
  - Alex said to understand what tokenizer does and write your own for full marks otherwise copying would have potential marks reduced
  - TA not clear on where the border is for copying code and loosing marks
  - No clear grading rubric given to TA
  - TA will email back about tokenizer feedback from Alex
  - Gordon looking for file uploading library
  - Evaluator, Validation, and react app needs to be done next week
  - Need to make demo video for final app next week
  
  

## 10/1/2020
### TA
- Clarification:
  - Use DECLARE to do a function rather than a variable
  - Could also do a LET here, and just check the names
- Possibly expand functions later to take multiple arguments
- Still need to add other image manipulation functions
- Is there a reason why we'd expect an extension?
  - limit strictly to pictures
  - sometimes other places have weird extensions, but what we have is good enough
- Clone
  - Should the user be forced to declare another variable instead?
  - Is it confusing? 
    - Not really, copies make sense
  - Could we do the same with let?
    - Doing that would be pointers
- More image processing commands is better
- Animation?
  - Able to save snapshots at a given amount of time
  - Should be able to implement this, but later
- General question from Gordon:
  - By next week, how much should we have done?
  - Four steps (tokenizing, parsing, validation, evaluation)
  - Should have tokenizer done by next week; hard to work on rest w/out it
  - We might be able to work on different parts at the same time
  - Still need to split up coding tasks
  - Evaluation will take the most time
  - We should have validation steps (we _need_ validation for grading, and throw correct errors)
    - Can build this into the parser/evaluation
    - Nothing extreme
 
  
## 9/24/2020 
### Group
- User Study
  - Maja, Raghav, Gordon are going to at least each do one user study
    - Maja: family/younger siblings, no coding experience
    - Gordon: someone taking an intro to cs course
  - Everyone makes duplicates of the thing/takes notes and don't show 'em
  - Code snippet should be explanatory enough
    - Ask if they want to be walked through it
    - EBNF?
- EBNF
  - let's try and get it done by 6 :)
 
### TA
- User study
  - Try to do it over zoom if possible
  - At least three users (two for prototype, maybe one later)
  - Don't use the same user twice (don't use prototype user for later stages)
  - Can be any person (doesn't have to be a technical user)
    - **Raghav:** People without a coding background might not have a good foundation 
    - **TA:** If users w/o coding background can use it, then it's good b/c they're in your user base. Variety of users w/ different backgrounds
  - What types of questions to ask
    - TA says that our sample is pretty good
 - Implementation ASAP
