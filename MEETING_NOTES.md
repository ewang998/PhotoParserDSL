# Meeting Notes

## 9/24/2020 (TA)
- User study
  - Try to do it over zoom if possible
  - At least three users (two for prototype, maybe one later)
  - Don't use the same user twice (don't use prototype user for later stages)
  - Can be any person (doesn't have to be a technical user)
    - **Raghav:** People without a coding background might not have a good foundation 
    - **TA:** If users w/o coding background can use it, then it's good b/c they're in your user base. Variety of users w/ different backgrounds
  - What types of questions to ask
    - TA says that our sample is pretty good
 - Implementation ASAP
